We work with this motto in mind, always challenging the limits of shapes, textures and materials, always thriving to fulfill your dreams, with absolute attention to details, and without any compromise on quality.

Our mission is to explore the grey space between art and design to create the most exquisite pieces that will complement the most elegant interiors.

### Limited editions

The work you can see on this website is available in limited editions, designed with consideration and crafted by hand with the utmost attention to details.

If you comission us to make one of these pieces, we will quickly start working on them. Because we have already made them, we can immediately start fabrication. Also, because these pieces already exist, you'll have a good idea of how they'll look in your settings.

When you decide to comission us to produce one of our limited edition pieces, you are looking to acquire a proven design, both elegant and exquisite, that will be made available to you in a timely manner.

### Bespoke work

If you require something special, we will be delighted to design a bespoke piece of furniture for you.

First, we'll need to meet with you to understand what you're after. You may have a brief that will help us design an original piece for you, or maybe your interior designer already knows what is needed. It can also simply be the case of talking together about existing pieces that you admire and deciding how we can draw inspiration from them to produce something new that will be truly yours. This stage usually requires only one meeting, ideally at the place where the piece will be installed, and with all the persons involved in the final decision.

Once we've understood what you really want, we'll start the design phase. We'll meet again to present you with our ideas and confirm that you are happy for us to proceed. We may bring you sketches for one or two ideas, rarely more, because we'll already have refined the design enough at this stage.

Ideally, this is when you confirm that you are happy for us to start working on your piece.

After that, we will regularly update you on our progress and you may come and visit us at some point to see your piece in the making.

When you decide to entrust us to make a bespoke piece for you, you want to experience the excitment of creative thinking, and you are ready to wait the necessary time for us to deliver a fully resolved design.
