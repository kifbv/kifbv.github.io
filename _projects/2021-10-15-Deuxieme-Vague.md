*Limited edition of 7 + 1 AP*

Simple lines provide a sleek and elegant result for this console table and conceal challenging techniques, necessary to preserve the slenderness of the top and its proportions in relation to the base.

That top is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure reinforced with fibreglass and then dressed with mapple veneers and lippings.
