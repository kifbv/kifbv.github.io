## Deuxieme Vague

*Console table - Aluminium honeycomb core, mapple veneer.*

Simple lines provide a sleek and elegant result for this console table and conceal challenging techniques, necessary to preserve the slenderness of the top and its proportions in relation to the base.

That top is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure reinforced with fibreglass and then dressed with mapple veneers and lippings.

Please [get in touch with us]({{ site.base_url }}/contact) if you'd like to learn more about this project or if you'd like us to design and build a bespoke console table for you.
